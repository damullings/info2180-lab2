                            Diversity and inclusion are also vital components for digital transformation to be equitable. Ms Danielle Mullings (Young Expert, Tech 4 Health) said that it is not enough for a young person to have a seat at the table; rather, the participation of youth needs to be systematically structured in the process of developing strategy and policy. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The values that youth can bring to the table as a digital native is immeasurable. She further commented that identifying under- or unrepresented perspectives will help reports and policy recommendations become actions that bring us closer to achieve UHC. </p>

                            I've entered three hackathons in the past three years and thus been apart of three #winning #hackathon teams!  
                            We won Coders of the Caribbean 2019! It's always a pleasure to learn from being a part of each team and each event, the most valuable of which being how to pitch an idea to investors. </p>
                            
                        <p>I also got the chance to speak with the Minister of Science and Technology, Hon. MP Fayval Williams at this year's staging.  It was a weekend well spent and I look forward to many more tech events as well as studying Software Engineering at UWI this year! Big up NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANK for sponsoring almost every tech event I've been to in JA. NCB clearly sees investing in Jamaica's tech rebirth and youth as a high priority.  And big up one of the best tech mentors Tremaine Buchanan </p>
